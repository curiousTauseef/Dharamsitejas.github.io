				<h1>She Celebrates the Little Things</h1>
				<p>
					You cheer for your family in all of our endeavors, big and small. 
					Whether it was our school or now at office, you were
					always there for us.
					But not tonight, mom. Tonight we'll toast to you.
				</p>
				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>

			<div id="flowers-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Creates Life on the Daily</h1>
				<p>
					You love to help things grow. Whether they be in the garden, or in your family,
					they're all in your heart. And it's so obvious, when you look at what remarkable 
					things spring up around you, that they are your doing. Without you I would not be
					the person I am today, and I know Mehul would say the same. We love you, Mom!
				</p>
				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
			</div>
			<div id="treasure-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Holds On to What She Loves</h1>
				<p>You keep safe everything that you care about. People, books, medicines, food -
					 the object itself does not matter. What matters is the value the object holds.
					 The more you collect, the more your color shows: you care. And that is a quality to
					 feel good about.
				</p>
				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
			</div>
			<div id="comfort-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Comforts Me When I'm Down</h1>
				<p>When I'm sad, I come to you for cheering up. Not because you're my mom, or
					 because you would always encourage to forget the failure or save from Dad, Mehul would quite a bit agree with this. No, because you are the only
					 person I know who consistently makes me feel better. Whether it's advice I need, or
					 just a pat on the back, you always know "exactly what to say". Thank you, mom.
				</p>
				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>

			<div id="home-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Makes This House a Home</h1>
				<p>Definitely when someone throws around things in the house so randomly, you are the one who keeps who gets things under control and makes this place worth living.

				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
			</div>
			<div id="lifesaver-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She's our Saviour</h1>
				<p>
				From making us good food and healthy to being Mehul's saviour all the time; to supporting DAD or for that matter all of us in our own personal endevours you always forgot yourself and were amazing backing us all the time.
				Thank you for always being there.
